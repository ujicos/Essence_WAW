However, please read the FAQ before opening a issue / asking for help, and keep it friendly.

#Installation
Download the current up-to-date files, navigate to your Local AppData folder (WIN+R and type &LocalAppdata%), Click the "Activision" folder, then CoDWaW, select the "mods" folder, if it doesn't exist simply make it.
Make a folder inside of mods titled "mp_essence" and place the ff and iwd files inside that folder, then select the mod from in-game via the mods menu or via fs_game command.
